📌 About

Trading Journal is a Django-powered web application that helps traders log and analyze their trades, similar to a fitness tracker but for trading performance.

Users can record trades with details like ticker, entry/exit prices, strategy, tags, and notes, while the system automatically calculates profit, PnL%, and trade status. The journal also provides data analytics and visualizations to help traders evaluate and refine their strategies.
